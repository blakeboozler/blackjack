This program is designed to simulate the card game Blackjack. In 
this variation, the game is played between the player and a dealer, 
where each hand consists of two initial cards. The goal is to get as 
close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) 
are valued at 10 points, and Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points 
depending on the player's hand. The player can choose to "Hit" 
(draw another card) or "Stand" (end their turn). If the player's hand exceeds
21 points, they "Bust" and lose the round. The dealer also plays under the 
rule of hitting until they reach a hand total of at least 17. If the dealer 
busts, the player wins. If neither player busts, the player with the higher 
total wins the round. If both have the same total, it is a tie or "Push."
The game continues until the player chooses to quit, and the total amount of
winnings or losses is displayed at the end.
